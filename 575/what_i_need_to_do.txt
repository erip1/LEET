1. (If not sorted, sort the array.)
2. 1st get the size of the array. 
   Because the size will be even and the people who get the candies are only two (1 brother and 1 sister), get the number of candies that need to be gathered. (E.g. if the number of candies given is 8, then set n = 4, where n is the number of candies that sister will get.)
2. From the array, group the items that have the same value together.
    (Hashmap will be used)
3. Pick each value from hashmap.
