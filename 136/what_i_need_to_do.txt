For anyone who didn't understood why this works here is an explanation. This XOR operation works because it's like XORing all the numbers by itself. So if the array is {2,1,4,5,2,4,1} then it will be like we are performing this operation

    ((2^2)^(1^1)^(4^4)^(5)) => (0^0^0^5) => 5.

Hence picking the odd one out ( 5 in this case).

2^1^4 = 10 + 01 + 100 = 111

111^101 = 010

010^010 = 000

000^100 = 100
